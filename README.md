My current setup to run Dotproject is on a mac using valet.

In the terminal and in the current directory of the project:
- type: valet link
- type: valet isolate php@7.4 
- type: then in the browser: http://dotproject.test

For running it in docker, see the [Original DotProject Readme](https://www.markdownguide.org)
