Notes to developers and users:

dotproject.sql is the full installation script for the latest CVS version.

upgrade_latest.sql is the differences between the last release version and
the current CVS version.  It will be renamed once a release is created.

Developers:  Please make sure you add your changes to both these files.
Do not add changes to version specific upgrade files.  Also make sure
you DATE STAMP your changes correctly.

Users: DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE FILES DIRECTLY.  Instead direct your
browser to install/index.php EVEN IF YOU ARE UPGRADING.  The installer
will patch your system correctly, or install a new system if required.
