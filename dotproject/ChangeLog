    ex: from (!$a || ($a && !$b)) to ((!$a || $a) && (!$a || !$b) to !($a && $b)

Author: merlinyoda <merlinyoda>
Date:   Fri Nov 7 20:12:33 2008 +0000

    Fix for Mantis Report #2532:
    Altered PEAR Date function dateDiff() to actually return the mathmatical
    difference of two dates (i.e. date1 - date2) as opposed to a count of days
    seperating date1 and date2.
    
    This is how most practically every other difference function is implemented.
    I have no idea why those responsible for that function thought it was a good
    idea to only return the absolute value.

    Fix for Mantis Report #2579:
    Used "centralized" getPermission() method defined in includes/permissions.php
    and adjusted some 'view' permissions to 'access' permissions, specifically in
    'vw_task_log.php' which task view uses and was unecessarily denying view
    access to task view.
    
    Also did some wide-spread clean-up (mainly by use of 'sed' on command line)
    to favor getPermission() method use over checkModule() and checkModuleItem()
    in included files (i.e. files included through main index.php) and removed
    any remaining unnecessary "$perms" permission object variables.

    Fix for Mantis Report #2615:
    
    Both getAllowedSQL() and and setAllowedSQL in classes/dp.class.php needed
    to be extended so that an alternate permissions module name could be
    specified instead of assuming that the calling object's table name and
    permission module name were the same and that access could be chaeck using
    the table name. This assumption fails in the smartsearch module as it does
    not extend the class in classes/dp.class.php and the defined table is not
    synonymous with the module which permissions should be checked against. The
    smartsearch module now makes use of this extended functionality to correct
    the problem.
    
    Also did some clean-up of the smartsearch module to make it more maintainable.

    Fixing issue noted in my comments on Mantis Report #2505:
    While prermissions are enforced when following links given by the smartsearch
    module, too many results appear giving the illusion of access. Issue resolved
    by checking "view" instead of "access" permissions on the item level.

    Further improvements on smartsearch and permissions:
    Results counts in smartsearch module accurately reflect counts based on items
    displayed as opposed to records retrieved (which we may not have view
    permissions on).
    
    Also added permission check so that for tasks logs to be "viewable" the
    associated task must also be viewable. This falls in line with our permissions
    hierarchy (Company -> Project -> Task -> Task Log).

    Cleaned up coding style in several files (e.g. make sure there is a space
    between 'if' keyword and opening paren) and substituted multibyte compatible
    string functions in non-third party codebase (i.e. PHP files not in lib
    directory) in place of less compatible string functions (e.g. mb_strlen()
    function in place of strlen() function)
    
    Most of both done with the help of grep command and carefully targeted use
    of the sed command.

    SMTPSend() in classes/libmail.class.php now tries to connect first using the
    ESMTP keyword "EHLO" and then falls back to older SMTP "HELO".
    
    Also, since ESMTP functions are potentially available, capability to apply TLS
    to a connection has been added should it be desired or required. Use of TLS is
    toggled by a new config value. If TLS is selected, the fallback to "HELO" is
    not done as the keyword "STARTTLS" is only available under ESMTP.

    Fix for Mantis Report #2663
    Needed to pass Task's name through dPformSafe first before writing to page.
    Also expanded dPformSafe to handle some "edge cases" like JavaScript literals
    and URIs.
    Tweaked previous fix to take advangage of new dPformSafe functionality.
