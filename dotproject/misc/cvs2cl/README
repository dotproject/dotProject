cvs2cl.pl by kripper

A hacked version of cvs2cl used to update DP's Changelog file

How To by John Pritchard (20 Feb 2003)

SITUATION 
You have a WIN2K workstation with Cygwin, WINCVS, and SSH capabilities installed. You want to execute Kripper's dotProject script "cvs2cl.pl" to create a ChangeLog from the dotProject CVSROOT.

EXECUTION
1) Make sure you have a working copy of dotProject downloaded. Basically, you just need access to the cvs2cl.pl script. Navigate to the root of the dotproject installation.

C:\{path}\dotproject\>

2) Set path to the SourceForge DotProject repository:

C:\{path}\dotproject\> set CVSROOT=:ext:{username}@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dotproject
C:\{path}\dotproject\> set CVS_RSH=ssh

3) Run the "cvs2cl.pl" script
C:\{path}\dotproject\> perl misc\cvs2cl\cvs2cl.pl --dp

(run "perl misc\cvs2cl\cvs2cl.pl --dp --accum" to only add new CL info to the existing, perhaps wrapped ChangeLog file)

OK this is all that is necessary to generate a new ChangeLog file that is nicely formatted with Kripper's dotproject output. Very nice tool provided by Kripper.

4) Your dotproject Root will now contain a new "ChangeLog" file. Simply check this into CVS to update the ChangeLog.
