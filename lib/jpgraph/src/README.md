Installation
------------
1. Make sure that the PHP version is compatible with the stated
   requirements and that the PHP installation has support for
   the GD library. Please run `phpinfo()` to check if GD library
   is supported in the installation.
   If the GD library doesn't seem to be installed,
   please consult the [PHP manual under section "Image"](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) for
   instructions on where to find this library. Please refer to
   the manual section "Verifying your PHP installation"

2. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice where your
   httpd server can access them.
   For a global site installation you should copy the files to
   somewhere in the PHP search path.

3. Check that the default directory paths in jpg-config.inc.php
   for cache directory and TTF directory suits your installation.
   **Note1:** The default directories are different depending on if
   the library is running on Windows or UNIX.
   **Note2:** Apache/PHP must have write permission to your cache
   directory if you enable the cache feature. By default the cache
   is disabled.
